Files for Exercise 1.1 are:
	1.1.sh -- main bash script that computes the integral
	1.1.get_data.sh -- computes integral error, time, and NP for the four cases
	1.1.out.txt -- output from 1.1.get_data.sh
	1.1.plots.py -- python script (matplotlib) to create the plots
	1.1.png -- both plots in a single figure
Files for Exercise 1.2 are:
	1.2.c -- computes factorials and Sterling approximation for N
	1.2.sh -- compiles 1.2.c, creates 1.2.exe, runs it and creates 1.2.out.txt
	1.2.out.txt -- stores results as (exact, sterling, difference, percent error)
        1.2.predict.R -- models the error as a function of log(N) and outputs R^2 
                         and expected N value where error is within 0.1%
        1.2.predict.txt -- output from R analysis above, giving an estimate of
                           NP = 82530
	1.2.plots.py -- python script (matplotlib) to create plot (also include error versus n)
	1.2.png -- both plots in a single figure
