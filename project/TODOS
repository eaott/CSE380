- actually have output from problem 1
- create the post-processing for problem 1
- write tests for problem 1
- write scripts for looking at convergence for both? algorithms
- address other fixmes around the codebase
  > grep -A2 -B2 "FIXME" src/* test/* includes/*
- presentation:
-- pr1: convergence / timing plots
-- pr2: convergence/timing for different methods
